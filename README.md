# TipsCalculator
Small TipsCalculator for iOS
This is a Tip Calculator application for iOS submitted as the pre-assignment requirement for CodePath.

Time spent: 7 hours

Completed:

- User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
- UI Animations
- Remembering the bill amount across app restarts. I did not add the expiration time implementation, it will keep the preference forever.
- Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.
